                            <p>As a Mobile App Development Intern for Modo Labs, I ideated and created 2 prototypes for Mobile SCU, my university's mobile application. Following this internship, I began working with my school to improve the app and develop these prototypes. </p>

                    <div class="super-inset">
                        <p>This prototype stemmed from the lack of personalization in the Mobile SCU App. The First-Year persona simplifies all the information students need to know, and features a home page only displayed to first-years. I enabled authentication so this page automatically appears when the student logs in. It contains a pre move-in checklist containing required Canvas modules, deadlines for payment and registration, etc. The completed tasks are stored as a user attribute so the checklist stores the changes. The final component to this prototype is a "Community" tab, which allows students to create and edit a profile, as well as view other student's profiles. For future iterations of this prototype, I ideated a chat feature to allow incoming students to connect with one another before coming to campus. This idea has since been adopted by Modo Labs and is undergoing Beta testing. Soon, the "Community" feature will be available for universities to help their own students connect. </p>

                        <p>The Student Center prototype is essentially a hub for students to explore on-campus organizations and get involved. I developed a student-led event calendar containing information about cultural events, acapella performaces, concerts, and more. I also created a page for students to explore the different student organizations on campus. Additionally, I programmed a filter based on difficulty and type of club, for easy club searching.</p>
