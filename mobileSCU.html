                            <p>As a Web Applications Assistant for SCU's technology department, I primarily focus on the SCU mobile application. As the main contributer to SCU Mobile, I am responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining an engaging and seamless experience for all users. I led the initial redesign of the app and created a student persona, offering students a more personalized experience, which launched earlier this year. I am currently developing 4 additional personas for prospective students, incoming first-year students, faculty, and alumni.  </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I work closely with ModoLabs, the platform that powers SCU Mobile, to ensure the app stays up-to-date and capitalizes on Modo's features and services. I also work alongside SCU's marketing team to help raise awareness about the app and ensure the redesigns align with SCU's initatives and branding.</p>

                        <p>The previous SCU Mobile app was difficult to navigate and visually overwhelming. With 24 unorganized and minimally styled tiles on the home screen, it was difficult for students to find specific information, which discouraged them from using the app. Through the redesign, I improved the navigation by breaking up the content into 6 main sections and utilizing Adobe Illustrator to create a visually engaging elements and icons. The results from my student research and analysis of Mobile SCU's analytics pointed me to another issue, which was low engagement with many of the app's pages. To address this, I created pages that students would access on a daily basis, such as building hours and live head counts in the gym. The result was an intuitive and interactive app for students to manage their campus life and connect with the Santa Clara community. </p>
